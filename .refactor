# Models
  - Move models out into lib and away from DB. They should become purely business oriented
    - How to handle validations? Is ActiveModel::Validations appropriate?
    - What about before_saves or equivalent? Should the business logic expose this but not do anything with it?

# Workers
  - Pull logic out into standalone file? Is the worker acceptable for the business logic area?
  - These are very simple

# Mailers
  - Should mailers be in the core lib?
  - How to handle views and routes to the views?

# Controllers
  - Controllers should just be collecting data and passing to business object
  - Is a Request going to become part of a business domain?
  - What if you could swap out Rails for Sinatra easily?
